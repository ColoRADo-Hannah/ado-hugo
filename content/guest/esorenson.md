After 16 years working as a systems/network administrator in the Bay Area, Eric relocated to Portland in 2012 to further develop his passion for awesome configuration management tools. When he's not grooming backlogs for Puppet, he's out enjoying Oregon's trails with his partner Jen, son Gunnar, and neurotic-yet-lovable pointer Indigo.
